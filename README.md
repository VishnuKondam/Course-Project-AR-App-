# AR-Chess
Augmented reality chess is a project that let us improve and modernize the game, making it attractive and novel for the youngest, by using augmented reality technology, we introduce a method using a one marker as a board and, and another one as a selector. 
In order to reproduce the same feeling and dynamics when we are playing the conventional chess game, we developed an augmented reality project that uses a pointer as a selector of any piece for the purpose of moving it when it is our turn.
